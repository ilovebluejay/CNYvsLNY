       <h1 style="color:Red;">CNY vs LNY - a brief introduction</h1>
       <hr>
       <h2><b>Intro:</b><h2>
       <h3>CNY, or Chineese new year and LNY, or Lunar New Year are two very different things, and today i will tell you why.</h3>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year">CNY Info</a>
       <h1 style="background-color:tomato;">CNY.</h1>
       <p><b>Chinese New Year</b>, also known as the <b>Spring Festival (春节, Chūnjié)</b>, is the most important traditional holiday in China and among Chinese communities worldwide. It's a time for family reunions, feasting, honoring ancestors, and celebrating new beginnings. Festivities can last up to 15 days, culminating in the Lantern Festival.
<hr>
<b>How is the Date Determined?</b><br>
Chinese New Year is based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar, which combines elements of both the moon phases and the solar year.
<hr>
<b>Lunar Month Start:</b><br>
The date always falls on the second new moon after the Winter Solstice, which typically happens between January 21 and February 20.
<hr>
<b>Solar Calendar Influence:</b><br>
Since the lunar calendar doesn't align perfectly with the solar year (the one our Gregorian calendar uses), the date shifts each year.
<hr>
<b>Key Factors:</b><br>
New Moon: CNY always begins on a new moon.
Lunisolar Correction: The Chinese calendar occasionally adds a "leap month" (like a leap year) to align better with the solar calendar.<hr></p>
<h1 style="background-color:tomato;">LNY, and their differences.</h1>
<p><b>1. Broader Scope of Lunar New Year (LNY)</b><br>
LNY encompasses various cultures across East and Southeast Asia, while CNY specifically refers to China's celebration.
LNY is celebrated in:
China: (Chinese New Year / 春节)
Vietnam: (Tết Nguyên Đán)
South Korea: (Seollal)
Mongolia: (Tsagaan Sar)
Singapore, Malaysia, and other Chinese communities.<hr>
<b>2. Differences in Zodiac Animals:</b>
Although many cultures use the Chinese Zodiac, some have key variations:<br>
Vietnam (Tết): Replaces the Rabbit with the Cat and Ox with Buffalo.
Mongolia (Tsagaan Sar): Uses Mongolian animal names but follows the same 12-year cycle.<hr>
<b>3. Regional Differences in Dates.</b>
LNY typically starts on the same new moon (between January 21 and February 20), but celebrations can vary:<br>
Vietnam (Tết): Sometimes begins a day earlier or later depending on lunar calendar calculations.
South Korea (Seollal): Often celebrated for three days, including the day before and after the new moon.<hr>
<b>4. Unique Cultural Traditions:</b><br>
China (CNY): Red envelopes, dragon/lion dances, and 15-day celebrations ending with the Lantern Festival.
Vietnam (Tết): Ancestral altar offerings, eating bánh chưng (sticky rice cakes), and kumquat tree decorations.
South Korea (Seollal): Bowing to elders (sebae) for blessings and eating tteokguk (rice cake soup).
Mongolia (Tsagaan Sar): Dairy-based feasts and wearing traditional deel robes.<hr>
<b>5. Food Specialties:</b>
China: Dumplings (jiǎozi), fish (symbolizing prosperity), and rice cakes.
Vietnam: Bánh chưng (square sticky rice cakes) and pickled vegetables.
Korea: Tteokguk (rice cake soup) and galbijjim (braised beef ribs).
Mongolia: Boiled lamb, milk-based foods, and steamed dumplings (buuz).<hr>
